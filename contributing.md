How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because you have taken a right step in order to form a regular habit of doing code daily.

Here are some rules/suggestions/requests!

1) Please don't copy the code for the internet in order to just make a successfull PR. Try to form your logic and code.

2) If you are not able to form the code, please raise and issue and somebody out there will help you to decode the logic behind it.

3) Never hestitate to use verstile data structures to solve a particular problem statement. 

4) Don't forget to add alot of comments in your source code! as in it will be help to evaluate the accurcy of the code.

5) Use indent two spaces (soft tabs), where ever needed.

6) Use HAML case while keeping long names.

7) This is open source repo. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a    car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
